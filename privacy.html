    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a Google Account, we can make those services even better – to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.

Our Privacy Policy explains:

What information we collect and why we collect it.
How we use that information.
The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.
We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Google so whether you are new to Google or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions contact us.
    </p>
    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p>
We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak,
to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which
YouTube videos you might like.
We collect information in the following ways:
Information you give us. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Google Account. When you
do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card to store with your
account. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly
visible Google Profile, which may include your name and photo.
Information we get from your use of our services. We collect information about the services that you use and how
you use them, like when you watch a video on YouTube, visit a website that uses our advertising services, or view and
interact with our ads and content. This information includes:
Device information
We collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device
identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Google may associate your device
identifiers or phone number with your Google Account.
Log information
When you use our services or view content provided by Google, we automatically collect and store certain
information in server logs. This includes:
details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.
telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and
date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls.
Internet protocol address.
device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser
language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.
    </p>
    <h2>How we use information we collect</h2>
    <p>
       We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new
ones, and to protect Google and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more
relevant search results and ads.
We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google Account. In
addition, we may replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented consistently across all
our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly
visible Google Profile information, such as your name and photo.
If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Google or on thirdparty
applications connected to your Google Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our services,
including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility
settings in your Google Account.
When you contact Google, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use
your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.
We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the
overall quality of our services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Google Analytics. For example, by
saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you
tailored ads, we will not associate an identifier from cookies or similar technologies with sensitive categories, such as those
based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.
    </p>
    <h2>When this Privacy Policy applies</h2>
    <p>
        Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Google Inc. and its affiliates, including YouTube, services Google
provides on Android devices, and services offered on other sites (such as our advertising services), but excludes services that
have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.
Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be
displayed to you in search results, sites that may include Google services, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy
Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may
use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.
