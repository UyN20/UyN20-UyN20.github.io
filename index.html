     <p>
      I'm Nicholas Uy. I'm a 15 year old boy discovering the world while in 
      High School. I like to try different things while also trying to figure 
      out what I will do in the future.
      I use this site to update you on my life and my interests. I talk about
      my life, my friends, tv show news, movie news, and my opinions on other 
      things.
    </p>
    <h2>My past and achievements</h2>
    <img src="./image/award.jpg" class="award-image"></img>
    <p>
      When I was in Middle school, I was one of the best in music, science, and 
      in S.T.E.M. I would be one of the best in most of my classes which 
      would help me to earn the Sheehan scholarship. Without it I wouldn't have
      been able to go to St. Peter's Prep.
    </p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I love many different things but most of all, I love tv, movies, and 
      comics. I like Marvel, Disney, Star Wars, DC comics, and others. Here are 
      some of my favorites and preferences.

    <h2 class="dctv-text-color">DCTV shows</h2>
    <p class="dctv-background">
        I love to watch all of the DCTV shows and my favorite ones are on the 
        channel "The CW". I love to rewatch both "Supergirl" and "Legends of 
        Tomorrow". It's fun to watch how the characters react 
        to one another and I think that the plot is more interesting and 
        crazy in the latest seasons.

    <h2 class="marvel-text-color">Marvel tv shows</h2>
    <p class="marvel-background">
        I also love to watch most of the Marvel tv shows in both the channel 
        "ABC" and in "Netflix". My favorites to watch is "Agents of SHIELD" and
        "Jessica Jones". The cast in both shows are amazing in portraying their 
        characters. If they're in the comics, they are loyal to the character 
        but if not, they're performance was still amazing. The ending in both 
        shows leave me wondering "How could this be? How could this happen?" I 
        really can't wait for the next seasons for both shows.
    </p>

    <h2>Other tv</h2>
    <p class="general-background">
        I also like to watch other non-comic book shows. For example, I like to
         watch "Scandal" on "ABC" and "Baby Daddy" on "Freeform". They're very
         interesting and are funny as well.
    </p>
    <h2>Movies</h2>
    <p class="general-background">
        I don't just love tv, I love movies as well. I like to watch a lot of 
        sci-fi movies. I like to watch movies for example "Star Wars" and "DC" 
        movies. I would also watch animation movies from "Disney", "DreamWords",
        and more. I could never choose the best movie because each are very 
        different and makes them distinct from all of the other ones.
