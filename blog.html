      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      <p>
          Welcome to my blog where I post every month about what I feel about 
          different things, whether it's my school or the world in general.

      <h2>My favorite memory of freshman year.</h2>
      <p>
          My favorite memory in freshman year was when we had freshman arts day.
          I really wanted to go to a play but I wasn't able to get in it in 
          time, so I had to go to a meuseum instead. I was really disappointed
          and I really didn't want to go but I went anyway. Luckily, I had my 
          friends with me there so it was too bad. The artifacts were 
          actually very interesting and some were funny.

      <h2>Best show this year.</h2>
      <p>
          So far an array of different shows came out and I watch many of them. 
          But at of all of them there is usually the best out of the others. 
          The one that has an amazing plot, great acting, etc. In my opinion, I 
          think that the tv show "Scandal" on "ABC" was the best this year. It 
          had high stakes with plenty of twists and turns for the characters. 
          It also left a lot of potential for it's next season. Sadly, the next
          season, season 7, will be it's last. Hopefully they make it better 
          than all of the others.
